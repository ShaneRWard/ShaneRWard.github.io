                    <h3>Front-End Technology</h3>
                    <p>The internet and the web are not actually the same thing. The internet is a network that spans the globe. The Web is a way of transmitting data over the internet using the HTTP protocol and HTML. The web is a series of interactions between clients and survers. Servers are applicatons that deliver content or services to clients.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Clients and Servers</h4>
                    <p>When a URL is put into a browser, the browser sends a request is sent to a DNS server which translates it into an IP address. That IP address is then used to find the host server and send a request for the desired content. The content is then sent to the browser and rendered.
                    - Depending on the content, the server may have to process the content first, such is the case with dynamic sites.
                    ## DNS and why it matters
                    - A DNS server is basically a phone book for the internet. A URL is like a name and it's IP address is like the phone number.
                    - When a new website is registered, it's assigned an IP address and registered with a DNS server.
                    - When a request is made, it checks with your local ISP DNS server to see if it has heard of that address. If it does, it will sent you the IP address. If it doesn't, it refers to a group of servers called root name servers, which know the name servers of all top level domains. They give the location of the .com name server to the browser. If the address is still not found, a DNS error is given.
                    - A site needs to be properly registered with a DNS or nobody will be able to find it.
                    - A site with multiple domain names need to all point to the proper IP.
                    - Ownership of the site needs to be properly registered. Changes will not be made without your consent.
                    - DNS caching can take up to 24 hours.</p>

                    <h4>Internet Protocols</h4>
                    <p>Protocols are simple languages that let computers share information with each other. The internet uses a group of protocols commonly referred to as the Internet Protocol Suite. It contains multiple types of protocols designed for specific tasks such as networking rules and data transfer. TCP/IP or Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol. Created in 1973, has become backbone of the internet. Is the main method that data is sent and recieved.
                    - Multiple layers of protocols are used in the Internet Protocol Suite.
                    - Application Layer: Handles creation and sharing of data over the web. Contains protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP which are used on a regular basis. 
                    - Link Layer: Defines how routers connect with each other over a network. 
                    - Transport Layer: Controls how ports are assigned and communicate with each other
                    - Internet Layer: Defines addresing and router structure for data across the network.
                    - Important to have a basic understanding of these.</p>

                    <h4>Exploring HTTP</h4>
                    <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol: Standard protocol for transmitting data over the WWW. Browser is a HTTP client, web server is an HTTP server. The client sends HTTP request, HTTP server responds with HTTP response which includes the requested content.
                    - Common Web Protocols: FTP (File Transfer Protocol) enables transfer of large files. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) used to send mail, POP used to recieve mail. RTP (Real-time Transfer Protocol) standard for audio and video.
                    - HTTP is a stateless protocol, means once a request has been sent and recieved by the client and server, is is discarded by both. Makes it highly efficient. Nothing is remembered. Storing persistent data for browsing sessions have to handles through other means. Usually handled through cookies, JavaScript, vaiables, or Server Session Management.
                    - HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. HTTP layering with a security protocol. Usually used for e-commerce or secure transactions.</p>

                    <p>
                    <h4>Anatomy of a URL</h4>
                    <li>Uniform Resource Locator: Specialzed string of characters that identifies the location of a desired resource.</li>
                    <li>http: The protocol. Tells the browser which protocol to use.</li>
                    <li>//www.lynda.com is the resource name. </li>
                    <li>// is for correct syntax.</li>
                    <li>www is subdomain</li>
                    <li>.lynda is the domain. Name that the browser uses to check with the server if the site exists or not.</li>
                    <li>.com is the top-level domain. Include .com, .org, .edu, etc.</li>
                    <li>Subdomain is a folder that your web content is located on a server. WWW is a default subdomain for most content, but others are used as well, usually for unique content.</li>
                    <li>URL should also specify the path on the server to the requested file and which port on the server to connect with. Not including one with result in a default to be used, usually 80. Usually safe to leave port number off. The port number is added onto the end of the top level domain with a collon: .com:80.</li>
                    <li>(www.lynda.com/search?q=web+design) In this URL, ? is a separater between url and parameters that are being passed into. Those parameters are called "name value pairs". q represents the query being made and the web+design represents the actual value of the request.</li>
                    </p>

                    <h4>How Browsers Work</h4>
                    <p>Browsers use HTTP to communicate with servers to request content. Once a page is fed to the browse, it uses it's internal rendering engine to render it on the screen. Additional content is rendered based on how and if the browser supports the content or plug-ins necessary to view them are installed.
                    - Typical components of a browser: The browser UI, contains the visual chrome, the address, bar and other interface components. The rendering engine parses HTML and CSS and controls visual rendering of pages. Browsers also have  built in netwoking components that are used to communicate through HTTP and other protocols. Data storage, used for session management. JavaScript Interpreter, another engine for executing any JavaScript code.
                    - Every browser has it's own unique components. The greatest noticable difference depends on how their renderin engines work.
                    - Most common rendering engines are Trident(Microsoft), Gecko(Firefox), Presto(Opera), WebKit(Apple and moble), and Blink(Chrome).
                    - Web designers should test their pages on multiple browsers and on multiple browser versions.</p>

                    <h4>Web Standards and the W3C</h4>
                    <p>In the 90s, Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer competed for dominance, "the browser wars". Each would release features that were not supported by other browsers. This was difficult for web designers because they would have to make multiple versions of the same page for different browsers.
                    - This led to the Web Standards Project in 1998. A group of web professionals and companies supported the W3C and the adoption of web standards. World Wide Web Consortium began in 1994 and attempted to standardize web protocols in technologies. Web Standards Project began referring to W3C recommendations as "Standards". Encouraged public by encouraging use of browsers that would follow those standards. In 2013, they announced that their work is now done.
                    - The importance of Standards: Writing to standards ensures consistency across supporting browsers. Web standards continue to evolve, make sure you track their progress.</p>

                    <h4>Web Server Basics</h4>
                    <li>Web servers are computers with specialized software and components. All web servers are assigned an IP address and the sites they host are registered in a DNS server.</li>
                    <li>Virtual Hosting: Allows a Web Server to host multiple web sites under a single IP address.</li>
                    <li>Shared hosting: Site is hosted on a server with multiple sites.</li>
                    <li>Dedicated hosting: Server hosts only one site.</li>
                    <li>Sites are stored as files and folders.</li>
                    <li>Web Stack: stack of software that works together to serve and process a webpage. Each has it's own distinct stack. Each usually has an operating system, a web server, a database server, and a programming language.</li>
                    <li>LAMP Stack: Linux(OS), Apache(web server), MySQL(Database Server), PHP or Python or Perl(Programming Language). Most popular type of stack.</li>
                    <li>Other common stacks: WAMP( Windowss, Apache, mySQL, PHP), WISA (Windows, IIS, MS SQL, .NET), MARS(mySQL, Apache, Ruby, Solaris)</li>

                    <h3>Back-End Technology</h3>
                    <h4>Server-side Scripting</h4>
                    <p>Any scripting or programming that happens on a web server is known as Server-side scripting. Originally, servers used to use CGI scripts (common gateway interface). Since then, many other programming languages and frameworks have developed. The server processes the script before sending anything back to the browser where it is rendered. The scripts sent to the server for server-side scripting is often something like a form, pulling information from a database, calculations, or some other processes. Those scripts are generally hidden from the user. This places the burden of processing on the server. This can slow down or crash the server if there is too much traffic or server load. A page refresh is usually required in processing data. AJAX and other client-side bridges help enhance the usability of server-side scripting.</p>

                    <h4>The Importance of PHP</h4>
                    <li>In 1994, Rasmus Lerdorf wrote CGI scripts to track visitors to his online resume.He then opened his sources to the public.</li>
                    <li>In 1997, Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski with Lerdorf rewrote the existing parser and released PHP 3.0 and renamed it Hypertext preprocessor, a powerful server side processing language. It was free and open source, so many people helped in it's continued development.</li>
                    <li>Paired with open source tools Linux, Apache, and mySQL, PHP became backbone of millions of sites.</li>
                    <li>Using PHP: You can find PHP on almost all hosting plans. Large pool of existing deveolpers to work with. PHP is relatively easy to learn, with a lot of available resources.</li>

                    <h4>Other popular server languages</h4>
                    <li>JSP: Java Server Pages: Part of the larger Java Framework. Scripts are combinations of XML and Java scriplets. JSP is widely used in enterprise-level sites, but can be used for any sized site or application. It's easy to find hosting, but be sure you're choosing the proper Java platform.</li>
                    <li>.NET: Visual Basic .NET is often referred to as .NET but is actually part of the larger .NET Framework. Often used for large-scale, enterprise sized sites or applications. Can only be hosted on Windows servers.</li>
                    <li>Coldfusion: Uses a markup language much like HTML. A central administrator makes many tasks simple.ColdFusion sites and applications often require less code than other languages. ColdFusion hosts can be harder to find and more exprensive than other choices.</li>
                    <li>Python: Powerful development language. Has a variety of web related libraries that make it easier to build sites and web-based applications. Typrically used to create larger sites or applications.</li>
                    <li>RUBY: General-purpose development language. It's popularity online i sdue largely to the Ruby-on Rails web framework. Rails has a simple syntax and powerful features, making it a popular choice for ceating dynamic sites.</li>
                    <li>Choosing a server-side language: Most designers choose a platform based on cost, developer network, and ease of use. Find a developer that can assist you in finding the right platform for your site. Research as many platforms as you can so that you can make an informed decision.</li>
                    
                    <h4>Dealing with Data</h4>
                    <p>Client side data storage had been limited to writing cookies until the release of HTML5. The Web storage API allows websites to store key value pairs in the browser to save user preferences. Larger sets of data can use XML(Extensive Markup Language) or JSON(JavaScript Object Notation). Databases are more ideal for robust sets of data. Databases are large tables of information. Some will allow you to store videos and images as well as text. Generally they are stored on the server, but there are those that can be used on the client side.</p>
                    <li>There are two competing meathods of storing data with the browser, Indexed DB and Web SQL</li>
                    <li>For online databses, there are two types: Relational Databases and Non-Relational Databases.</li>
                    <li>Relational Databases: Store data in tables that relate to each other based on item key values. This allows for complex sortingand filtering of data. Oracle, mySQL, Sybase, and other SQL-based databases are popular relational databases.</li>
                    <li>Non-Relational Databases (Non-SQL): Alternative to relational databases that are growing in popularity. NoSQL databases store data individual flat, object driven datasets. These are often faster to index, and scle easier than relational databases. MongoDB, CouchDB, SimpleDB, HBase, CouchBase, and Cassandra are popular NoSQL databases.</li>
                    
                    <h4>Using SQL Databases</h4>
                    <p>SQL: Structured Query Language is the standard language used for managing and retrieving information from databases. SQL syntax is simple and logical, the basics are easy to learn. Select, Insert Update, Delete and other simple statements are used to retrieve and manipulate data. There are multiple versions of SQL, each with its own extensions. SQL queries are usually written through web appication code. Dedicated applications like mySQL can help you create and manage databases. Although web designers don't need to become fluent in SQL, understanding the basics is important.</p>
                    
                    <h4>CMS (Content Management System):</h4>
                    <p>An application designed to control the creation, management, publishing, and archiving of a site's content. Benefits of CMS include updating content can be done though a WYSIWYG editor, making it easy for non-technical people to update site content. Most CMS allow you to create user groups with various permission levels. This flexibility allows users to create content, pages, and regions within the site without involving a designer. Most CMS have plugins and extensions that add powerful features to sites. They come in many options: some CMS are hosted online and only require an account to start building hosted sites. Other CMS can be installed on your own web server. Features and page customization vary greatly between CMS, be sure to research the features you need. Popular CMS include Joomla, Drupal, Movable Type, ModX, Radiant, WordPress, and Expression Engine.</p>
                    
                    <h4>CDN (Content Delivery Network)</h4>
                    <p></p>A system for delivering content over a distributed network of servers. Content is spread across servers all over the world. Server load is reduced. CDNs are largely used to serve static resources such as javascript libraries, video, or other site dependencies. Using Google's Hosted Libraries reduces load from your server, speeds the delivery of jQuery to the client, and increases the likelihood that the client will have jQuery cached.</p>
                    <li>Types of CDNs: Some CDNs hos a single type of resource like Bootstrap or Google's hosted libraries. CDNs like YouTube serve not only as delivery networks, but content aggregators as well. You can choose between numerous free or commercial CDNs for dedicated service. Popular CDNs including Akamai, CloudFare, Amazon's CloudFron, EdgeCase, and Windows Azure.</li>
                    <li>CDN issues: A CDN adds an additional layer of complexity to your site. For dedicated resources, you don't have the ability to create custom downloads or specific minified versions. Certain security requirements might prevent the use of an external CDN.</li>

                    <p>
                    <h4>Cloud Services</h4>
                    <li>Cloud Computing: A distributed network of computers that can perform tasks by taking advantage of the scale and power of the network. Usually refers to distributed processes over the internet.</li>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <h4>GitHub</h4>
                    <li>Github is an online distribution service that allows users to store repositories nline that can be version controlled and shared by others.</li>
                    <li>Built around Git, an open source vesion control system.</li>
                    <li>Allows you to manage projects, publish files, and store revisions.</li>
                    <li>Offers both free and commersial plans.</li>
                    <li>Features an easy to use web interface.</li>

                    <h3>Assembly Technologies</h3>
                    <h4>JavaScript Libraries</h4>
                    <li>A collection of prewritten JavaScript methods and functions that make it easier to perform targeted tasks.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript libraries extend the functionality of native JavaScript. They range from the extremely focused sts like Date.js to the broader task-oriented libraries like jQuery.</li>
                    <li>In the HTML, there needs to be a script linking the JavaScript Library. The browser will download it and makes it available to use. Then all scripts that use methods or objects from the library will operate properly.</li>
                    <li>Pros: Using libraries makes the process of writing JavaScript more efficient. You can often extend your own coding capabilities through libraries. The code is widely used and tested, with contributors improving the code on a consistent basis.</li>
                    <li>Cons: Libraries increase the size of your code, and often add additional server requests. You can become tied to specific library syntax. Without knowing native JavaScript you're not always making an informed choice as to when a library is appropriate.</li></p>

                    <p>
                    <h4>Frameworks and boilerplates</h4>
                    <li>Collections of prebuilt CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files designed to speed development of sites.</li>
                    <li>Boilerplate: A set of templates built around a specific starting point of goal. Meant to provide a starting point for building sites or apps.</li>
                    <li>Framework: A collection of assets designed to help build sites or applications. This could include CSS grids, javaScript libraries or helpful scripts, and HTML templates.</li>
                    <li>Complex UI Frameworks: Frameworks like Bootstrap are built around developing the front end of sites or applictions. Thes UI Frameworks function more like development tools. While they add the most overhead, they also give developers the widest set of tools to work with.</li>
                    <li>Minimal Frameworks: Minimal Frameworks typically have a singular goal or focus. Designed to have a small footprint and help out in specific areas. The type of framework right for you will be largely based on personal pilosphy and project type.</li>
                    <li>Prototyping: Frameworks are often used to build HTML prototypes. Using a framework can dramatically speed up prototype development and iteration. In most cases framework code is NOT used for final production.</li>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <h4>CSS Preprocessors</h4>
                    <li>Scripting language that extends the functionality of CSS and must be compile to native CSS coding before publishing.</li>
                    <li>Benefits: They add additional functionality that CSS lacks. Their syntax makes writing CSS more efficient. Many browser inconsistencies are dealt with automatically when the CSS is processed.</li>
                    <li>Most popular are Sass by Ruby, less by JavaScript, stylus by JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Cons: In team environments, or if the production code is shared, everyone will need to know the preprocessor syntax. Processed CSS can be bloated and inefficient. Additional layer of complexity to workflows.</li>
                    </p>
