      <h2>Welcome to my site</h2>
          <p>I'm a working college student trying to find my path. I have numerous interests including gaming, photography, fabrication, coding, and science just to name a few. My current degree is in geology, but that may change. I started college ten years after graduating from high school, basically just dipping my toe in to see if I liked it at all. I found that I enjoyed the experience. Shortly after starting my second semester, the effects of the recession caught up with me and I was laid-off from my job of many years. Instead of succumbing to dispair, I saw it as an opportunity to dive into my college career and see what I was capable of.</p>

          <p>At first I made quite a lot of progress, and excelling in every class. I maintained a 4.0 GPA for several years and was awarded the Dean's List several times. I should point out that after 10 years out of high school had left me in need of a refresher and I had to start much of my education over again. Many of the classes I took were simply territory rediscovered after years of neglect. This is not to say that some classes were not challenging or new to me. I have grown significantly since I began my journey into higher education.</p>
          
          <p>Things became more difficult as semesters went by. Classes are harder, I had to start part-time work to pay the bills, and my girlfriends health has impacted the both of us rather hard. Trying to pass the necessary classes while navigating these challenges has made me rethink my path. So, as a result, I am venturing into coding. And here we are today. Thank you for joing me on my journey! Check the blog for updates!</p>
